Flat Config Parser
====================

The goal of this project is to provide a simple module that can load a JSON 
defaults file, read a flat configuration file and parse command line arguments.

Synopsis
----------

Usually an application needs a basic `defaults` structure, some `config files` 
that override defaults and `command line arguments` that override the resulting
object.

The usual scenario is when **Flat Config** loads a JSON file for defaults,
then loads a `key-subkey=value` style configuration file and mixes that with 
command line arguments.

You may also provide **Flat Config** with any existing javascript object and
it will work. You can also provide an array of configuration entries instead of
the config file if you feel more comfortable with that.

API
-----

A basic example

    // Initialize flatconfig
    var flatconfig = require('flatconfig');
    
    // 
    var args = flatconfig.parseArgs(process.argv.slice(2)),
        config = flatconfig.loadConfig(__dirname + '/cfg.json', 
                  path.resolve(process.cwd(), args['config']), 
                  args),
  
  
### flatconfig.loadConfig(defaults, [config, [args]])

### flatconfig.parseArgs(args, [flatobj])

### flatconfig.flatten(args, [obj])

### flatconfig.deflatten(obj, [args, [prefix]])
